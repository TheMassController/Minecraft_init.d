This init script is capable of stopping, starting, restarting a Minecraft, Bukkit or Tekkit server. It can also insert commando's into a MC/Bukkit/Tekkit server. The script depends on the uniqueness of the name of the jarfile for checking if the server is still alive and the screen name must also be unique to make sure the script finds the correct screen to send commandos to. 

Tested and created on Debian 6, don't see any reason why it should not work on Ubuntu. May also work on CentOS/RedHat/Fedora, but I am not so sure about that. 

Depends on Screen and Java. Tested with OpenJDK JRE 6 headless.

Usage:
You may want to update the following variables:
SERVICE: The name of the jarfile (Must be unique for every MC server you want to run)
USERNAME: The user that is going to run minecraft. (Everything in the MC folder should be owned by this user)
SCREENNAME: The name of the screen that is goig to run minecraft (Must be unique for every MC server you want to run)
MCPATH: The absolute path to the folder of the MC server.
CPU_COUNT: The amount of CPU cores you want the MC server to use.

MAXHEAP and MINHEAP set the amount of RAM that MC will use. If find the current settings (0.5 GB min, 1 GB max) to be working fine on my server, which goes up to ten persons. For Tekkit 2G min and 3G max is advised (I run tekkit with 1G min/max, works fine).
BYTESUFFIX handles the suffex, which inplicate if the MINHEAP and MAXHEAP are set as MB, GB, etc. See `man java` for more details.

HISTORY is the amount of lines that is saved in the screen session. So if you connect to the MC screen session you can, per default, read a maximum of 1024 lines back.
INVOCATION is the command that will be used to start the MC server.

Installation:
-Put this script in /etc/init.d/ under a name of your choosing (let's go for minecraft_server in this example)
-Chmod it to be owned by Root and exectuable (chown root:root /etc/init.d/minecraft_server; chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft_server)
-Now you can use it! Type `service minecraft_server start` to start it, type `service minecraft_server` to see all possibilities

To make sure it starts on boot and stops gracefully on shutdown:
-`insserv minecraft_server`
See `man insserv` for additional information
